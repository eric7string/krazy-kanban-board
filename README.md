## Description
A full stack React kanban board application that allows users to login, have their passwords hashed, and have the users authenticated using JWT. The id-tag for each logged in user is stored in local storage and removed upon logging out.

## Usage
Navigate to deployed application URL [HERE](https://krazy-kanban-board.onrender.com/). Click the login button at the top right of the page and enter username (RadiantComet) and password (password) to log in. Once logged in, you will be directed to the main page. From here, open your developer tools in chrome and navigate to the application tab, and open the local storage menu to view id tag. Once the logout button is clicked, the ID tag is removed from local storage.
